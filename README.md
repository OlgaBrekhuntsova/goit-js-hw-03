-----TASK-1-----

Write a function slugify(title) that takes an article title (the parameter
title) and returns a slug created from this string.

The value of the parameter title will be strings where words are separated only
by spaces.

All characters in the slug must be in lowercase.

All words in the slug must be separated by hyphens.

Take the code below and insert it after declaring your function to check if it
works correctly. The results of its execution will be displayed in the console.

-----TASK-2-----

Write a function called makeArray that takes three parameters: firstArray (an
array), secondArray (an array), and maxLength (a number). The function should
create a new array that contains all elements from firstArray, followed by all
elements from secondArray.

If the number of elements in the new array exceeds maxLength, the function must
return a copy of the array with a length of maxLength elements.

Otherwise, the function must return the entire new array.

Take the code below and insert it after declaring your function to check if it
works correctly. The results of its execution will be displayed in the console.

-----TASK-3-----

Write a function filterArray(numbers, value) that takes an array of numbers
(numbers) and a value (value) as parameters. The function should return a new
array containing only those numbers from the numbers array that are greater than
value.

Inside the function:

Create an empty array where you will add the suitable numbers.

Use a loop to iterate through each element of the numbers array.

Use an if statement inside the loop to check each element and add it to your
array.

Return your new array with the suitable numbers as the result.

Take the code below and insert it after declaring your function to check if it
works correctly. The results of its execution will be displayed in the console.
